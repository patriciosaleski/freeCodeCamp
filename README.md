## Features

- Includes .ts and .scss files
- Live previews
- Responsive design
- Also includes test for each challenge


## Lessons Learned

As a junior web developer I want to focus this project on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and implementing what I have been learning about TypeScript.

At the same time start using unit tests for each challenge and demonstrate the correct functioning of them.

Any kind of feedback is welcome!
